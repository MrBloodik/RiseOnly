## üèó Architecture (Feature‚ÄëSliced Design)

We follow the FSD approach to keep code organized by features, not by technical layers:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/              # Entry point, global providers (state, i18n, theming)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/            # Top-level route components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/          # High-level UI blocks combining features and entities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/         # Isolated business logic and actions (auth, comments)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/         # Data models, API integrations, and state slices
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/           # Reusable utilities, UI components, and styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ processes/        # Long-running scenarios (WebSocket connection, background sync)
```

This structure ensures:

* **Clear responsibility boundaries**
* **Easy onboarding** for new developers
* **Scalable codebase** as features grow

## üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup

> **Note:** The backend services cannot be run locally by community users. A running demo environment is provided instead.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/riseonly.git
   cd riseonly
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   yarn install   # Installs all workspace packages: backend, frontend, mobile
   ```
   
3. **Configuration**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the `frontend/` and `mobile/` folders.
   * Fill in public API endpoints and environment variables as provided in the demo documentation.
     
4. **Run the applications**

   ```bash
   # Web frontend
   cd frontend && yarn start

   # Mobile app (Expo)
   cd ../mobile && yarn start
   ```

*Backend-specific setup is restricted; instead, you can access a hosted demo or request a video walkthrough.*
